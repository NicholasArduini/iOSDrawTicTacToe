# iOSDrawTicTacToe

* iOS Application in which the user can use multi-touch gestures to draw a tic tac toe game board. 
* Once these lines for the board are draw they are identified and each cell is located. 
* Either an X or O can start the game and the next corresponding player must go next. When a player draws a shape it is identified and if it does not resemble their shape, either X or O, it is erased and their turn is still in play. Similarly if the shape is drawn in a currently filled cell. 
* The users can reset the board with a double tap, only if the game is not in play. 
* In the event of a win, a line is drawn connecting the points identifying the winner, their score will increase by one, and a menu will appear identifying the winner, current score, a clear score option, as well as a play again button. The play again button clears the game board and resets the game. 
* In the event of a tie a menu will appear identifying a tie as well as the same options in the event of a win.
